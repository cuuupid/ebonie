Welcome to Gaul.

After booting up a strange artifact of a computer, you find yourself in a foreign world. All around you, there is what seems to be a hall and some few doors.
Gaul doesn't want you to leave. In order to escape, you must beat all three dimensions of puzzles in order to shutdown Gaul and return to your world.

Are you up to the challenge?
